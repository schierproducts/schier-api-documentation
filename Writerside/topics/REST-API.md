# REST Reference

The Stripe API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms) request bodies, returns[ JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The Schier Product API doesn't support any write/update methods outside the administrative interface. All requests are read-only.
